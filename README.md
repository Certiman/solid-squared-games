## Intention
This is an experimental implementation to solve easy 2d puzzles by using [ZOD](https://zod.dev/?id=table-of-contents)'s type parsing and SolidJS's reactivity in the front-end. The idea is that a solution to the puzzles can be generated by having the individual cells and the total gamefield apply rule-checking functions which trigger state changes throughout the gamefield. Cells are therefore eliminating impossible (throwing ZodErrors) states and through solidJS' reactivity mechanisms, this propagates through the gamefield.

## Status
- [X] A preliminary validation and type collection for the cells and gamefield
- [ ] Working out the rule functions for cells and gamefield
- [ ] Propagation through the gamefield through solidJS components for cells and gamefield.
